# Mad Libs Story Generator
[Watch the demo]
This is a basic Mad Libs-style program where the user inputs nouns, adjectives, and verbs to create a short, fun story. The program begins by prompting the user to provide words, ensuring each input contributes to the final narrative.

Once all inputs are collected, the story is dynamically generated using the provided words. The result is a humorous dialogue between two characters who debate their habits before ultimately agreeing to continue doing what they love. The final story is printed, making for a fun and interactive experience.
This is also my first python program.
